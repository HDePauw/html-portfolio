<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is Hans De Pauw. Currently living in the small town of Geraardsbergen, Belgium, that is mostly known by cyclist's for a passage in the Tour Of Flanders with "de muur".
</p>

<p>At the moment I work in a factory where we make connectors for High Voltage powerplants and Medium Voltage substations. I work in the weekends, doing 12h shifts, as a High Voltage tester. The testing department is the final step in the production line, where we make sure every piece is up to code, before shipping it to the clients.</p>

<p>I'm always eager to learn something new, so I started this Web Development course. Looking to change my career path with something that requires me to keep learning.</p>
